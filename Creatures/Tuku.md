# The Tuku

## Nature and Appearance

The Tuku are small, stocky creatures that make their homes in complex burrow systems across the eastern plains. They stand roughly waist-height to a human child, with disproportionately large heads and round, fixed eyes that require them to turn their entire head to look around. Their movements are quick and deliberate, combining animal wariness with clear intelligence.

## Culture and Behavior

Unlike simple beasts, the Tuku have mastered basic crafts. They wear crude garments fashioned from cured hides and carry tools of worked stone - most commonly spears for hunting and rounded stones for cracking nuts and roots. They communicate through a language of clicks and chirps, which seems limited to practical matters like warnings, territory marking, and coordinating hunting parties.

They live in social groups centered around their burrow systems, with dozens of families sharing a single network of tunnels. These colonies work together to gather food, watch for threats, and defend their territory. Their intelligence seems to lie somewhere between clever animals and thinking beings - enough to make tools and coordinate actions, but not enough for complex cultural practices.

## Territory and Habits

The Tuku are primarily hunters and gatherers, venturing out from their burrows to collect roots, seeds, and small prey. While generally cautious around humans, they can become dangerous in large numbers, particularly if they feel their territory is threatened. They show remarkable coordination during these encounters, using simple tactics to surround and overwhelm larger creatures.

## Relations with Other Peoples

The Suranai, who call them "People of the Earth," maintain a cautious respect for the Tuku. Their caravans leave small offerings of food and cloth near known burrow systems, considering it a good omen if the gifts are accepted. These offerings seem to reduce the likelihood of their wagons being raided, though whether this represents true understanding or mere conditioning is debated.

The relationship with the Dramii has grown more complex as these traditionally nomadic people have begun settling in permanent villages. Tuku colonies near these settlements sometimes raid food stores and gardens, leading to increasing conflict. Some Dramii villages have taken to building deep ditches around their boundaries, as the Tuku seem reluctant to cross open spaces where they would be exposed to predators.

## Captivity

In the Imperial City, some nobles keep captured Tuku as exotic pets, a practice that has created demand for trappers despite the creatures' poor survival rate in captivity. Removed from their colonial groups and complex burrow systems, captive Tuku often become listless and eventually stop eating. Those that survive never show the same level of activity or intelligence seen in their wild kin.

## Vignette: A Trading Stop

The Kakari caravan halted as their lead wagon-master spotted the familiar pattern of Tuku burrow entrances dotting a nearby hillside. With practiced motions, the traders set out small bundles of colored cloth and dried fruits at regular intervals, careful not to approach the burrows directly.

As they prepared their evening meal, round eyes watched from the burrow entrances. Gradually, small figures emerged - first one, then several, moving with that distinctive head-turning motion. They approached the offerings cautiously, communicating with soft clicks. One picked up a piece of red cloth, turning it over with surprisingly dexterous fingers before chirping to its companions.

The caravan master motioned for her people to continue their work without staring. "Best to let them satisfy their curiosity," she murmured. "A moment's patience now means safe passage tomorrow." She'd learned long ago that while the Tuku might not understand much, they never forgot a slight - or a kindness.

# Dawn Gathering

As morning mist lifted from the plains, dark shapes emerged from the hillside burrows. The Tuku moved in small groups, their large heads turning in constant motion as they surveyed the grassland. The youngest stayed close to the burrow entrances, practicing with tiny spears on grass stalks, while the adults spread out in a practiced formation.

One raised its head and clicked rapidly - a warning about something in the distance. The pattern was taken up by others, heads turning in unison to track unseen movement in the grass. A final deeper click from an elder sent them moving as one, their stocky forms disappearing into the longer grass with surprising grace. Only their occasional head movements, bobbing above the stalks, betrayed their careful stalk toward breakfast.

# The Offering

Mirava laid out the trading cloth with practiced care - a handspan from the nearest burrow entrance, close enough to show respect but not so near as to threaten. On it she placed three measures of dried fruit, a length of red cloth, and a handful of the glass beads the Tuku seemed to prize. Her grandmother had taught her the old way: arrange everything in groups of three, never watch directly, and hum the old trading song just loud enough to be heard.

The first click came from her left - then another from behind. She kept her movements slow and deliberate as she stepped back, still humming. Only when she reached the wagon did she turn to watch. They emerged in pairs, their round eyes fixed on the offerings. An elder - distinguished by the complexity of its hide garment - approached first, inspecting each item with quick turns of its entire head. Its approval came as a series of rapid clicks, bringing the others forward.

As they gathered the offerings, one small Tuku left behind a perfectly rounded stone and what appeared to be a carefully arranged bundle of colorful feathers. Mirava smiled - her grandmother had spoken of such exchanges, but she'd never seen one herself. The stone would bring luck to the caravan, or so the stories said.

# The Imperial Market

The Tuku in the gilded cage hadn't moved in three days. It sat in the corner, its large head bowed, refusing the expensive nuts and fruits the merchant offered. Its hide garment, once decorated with intricate patterns of dyed leather and tiny bones, hung loose and unkempt.

"Finest specimen from the eastern plains," the merchant proclaimed to passing nobles, though his voice held less conviction than a week ago. "Observe its almost human hands, its clever eyes..."

But those who paused at the cage saw only a small, broken thing. Gone was the quick intelligence that marked wild Tuku, the constant head movements, the curious clicks and chirps. Even the glass beads woven into its garment - beads that had once caught and reflected light like tiny stars - seemed dull now.

When night fell and the market grew quiet, a sound rose from the cage - not the usual clicking speech of its kind, but a low, continuous tone that made passing guards shudder and walk faster. By morning, the cage stood empty, though none could find where the lock had been broken or the bars bent. Only a small, perfectly rounded stone remained, placed with what almost seemed like deliberate care in the cage's center.

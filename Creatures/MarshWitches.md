# The Marsh Witches

Along the eastern marshlands, where brackish waters meet the plains, travelers speak in hushed tones of the Marsh Witches. These tales, passed between Suranai caravans and whispered in Phasharthi fishing villages, tell of lonely figures seen through the mist, carrying small lights and calling for help.

Those who trade tales late at night speak of gaunt figures, sometimes naked, sometimes in sodden rags, moving with an unnatural gait through the fog. Most stories agree they appear pitiful at first - lost travelers or injured wanderers seeking aid. Yet in every telling, those who offer comfort or show them pity are never seen again.

An old Phasharthi gatherer claims her grandmother's sister once encountered such a being at dusk. It appeared as a young woman, shivering and confused, pleading for help with tears running down its pale cheeks. Only the grandmother's strict warnings kept her from approaching when she noticed how the figure's movements seemed wrong, like a puppet with tangled strings. She steeled her heart against its increasingly desperate cries and fled. Behind her, the piteous weeping turned to something that might have been laughter.

Some say these creatures are the undead remains of those claimed by the marshes, risen with bitter hearts to prey upon the kindness of the living. Others insist they're something older - creatures that have always dwelled in these waters, feeding on human mercy like others feed on flesh. The Phasharthi teach their children songs to steel their hearts against strange voices in the mist, and mothers warn their young never to show pity to figures seen in the fog, no matter how desperate they might seem.

What's known is this: when fog lies thick upon the marshes, no one travels alone. If you see a light bobbing through the mist, accompanied by calls for help, you must harden your heart and turn away. For the Marsh Witches hunt not with strength or speed, but with human compassion itself. They will appear ever more pitiful, ever more desperate, testing your resolve with tears and pleas. But to offer them comfort, to show them mercy, is to seal your fate. Those who succumb to pity are said to be dragged down into the dark waters, their own kindness becoming their doom.

Some say that on particularly misty nights, multiple lights can be seen bobbing through the fog, accompanied by a chorus of weeping voices. The Phasharthi believe these are all those who failed to heed the warnings, now transformed into Marsh Witches themselves, forever seeking to lure others to share their fate.

# The Warning

"Mind the fog rolling in," old Selina said, adjusting her phasun as she watched her granddaughter prepare her gathering basket. "Reminds me of the night my sister Maretha disappeared."

The girl paused, knowing better than to speak. Her grandmother rarely mentioned her lost sister.

"She had a tender heart, Maretha did. Too tender." Selina's weathered hands worried at the shell beads on her belt. "We warned her, of course. Everyone knows not to answer calls in the mist. But she always said it was cruel, how we turned our backs on those needing help."

The old woman's eyes fixed on the gathering darkness beyond their door. "That night, she heard a child crying in the marshes. Swore she could see a small figure through the fog, lost and afraid." Selina's voice grew quiet. "By the time we realized she'd gone out, there was nothing left to find but her phasun, floating in the black water. And sometimes, on nights like this, I think I hear her voice calling from the mist. But it's not her voice anymore."

She gripped her granddaughter's arm. "Remember - a hard heart in the fog is better than a kind heart in the depths."

# The Test

The fog came sudden and thick, turning the marsh path into a grey void. Kalimo drew his trade-wagon to a halt, cursing softly as he lost sight of the caravan ahead. A light appeared in the murk - another wagon's lamp, he hoped.

But no wagon moved so strangely, swaying like a dancer underwater. As it drew closer, he made out a figure carrying the light. A woman, stumbling as if injured, her clothes dripping wet.

"Please," the voice was barely a whisper. "I've lost my way. Won't you help me?"

Kalimo's hands tightened on the reins. His mother's words came back to him: "The Marsh Witches test your heart. Each time you resist their pleas, they try harder to break your resolve."

The figure stumbled closer. In the lantern light, he saw tears streaming down its too-pale face. "Please," it sobbed, "I'm so cold, so afraid..."

Kalimo began to sing the old trading songs, forcing himself to focus on the rhythm, drowning out the increasingly desperate cries. When the mist finally cleared, he was alone on the path, his horse trembling in its harness.

# The Tale-Trading

In the Suranai night market, where stories were traded like silk and spice, an old woman offered to sell the tale of how she survived a Marsh Witch. The price was steep - three memories of summer sunlight - but the gathered traders paid willingly.

"I was young," she began, her voice carrying in the lamp-lit dark. "Walking the marsh edge, gathering roots. The fog rolled in, and I heard my mother's voice calling. But my mother was three days dead."

She leaned forward, firelight catching the silver in her hair. "It wore her face, that thing in the mist. Called me 'daughter,' begged me to help her find her way home. And oh, how I wanted to go to her. But my mother taught me better than that."

The old woman's eyes were distant with memory. "Seven times it called me. Each time with a different voice I loved. Each time, I kept walking. When dawn finally came, I found myself at the marsh's edge, my feet bloody from running, but alive. The others they found that week weren't so fortunate. The fog had been thick for days, and not everyone has the strength to turn away from a loved one's voice."

She fingered the iron pendant at her throat. "Remember this: if you hear a voice you love calling from the mist, walk on. Whatever answers you in the marsh, it's not your loved one. No matter how sweet their words, no matter how they cry and beg. The dead are dead, and what wears their voices wants only to make you one of them."

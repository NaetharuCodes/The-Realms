# The Suranai

In the broad plains of the Eastern Realms, where vast grasslands are dotted with small forests, travel the wagon-dwelling peoples. Known for their richly colored clothing and vast wagon trains, they move across the plains carrying news and trade. Three major groups define these peoples:

### The Kakari

The most widely traveled of all the Eastern peoples, the Kakari have developed extensive connections throughout the Realms.

**Notable Characteristics:**

- Masters of diplomatic relations and trade protocols
- Maintain extensive oral histories of trade routes and relationships
- Distinctive dress that blends their traditional style with influences from other cultures
- Renowned linguists and translators
- Travel in large, specially-modified wagons for long-distance trade

### The Lories

Dwelling near the Eastern Watch Tower, the Lories maintain many ancient traditions.

**Notable Characteristics:**

- Travel in smaller, traditional caravans of about twelve wagons
- Famous for their instrument crafting, particularly violins
- Maintain ancient musical traditions and songs
- Host annual music festivals that draw visitors from across the Realms
- Hold deep knowledge of old magics due to their proximity to the Watch Tower

### The Dramii

A group in transition, the Dramii have begun establishing permanent settlements in the northern realms.

**Notable Characteristics:**

- Maintain both traveling caravans and permanent villages
- Settlements serve as gathering points for celebrations
- Developing new crafting traditions requiring permanent workshops
- Known for innovative metalworking that combines traditional and new techniques
- Operate seasonal schools for children from traveling families

## Vignettes

### The Evening Camp

The sun was setting across the grasslands when Mirava began to unfold her family's stretch of painted canvas, the fabric rippling with images of birds in flight worked in threads of gold and red. Around her, the Kakari caravan was settling into their evening ritual - twelve great wagons drawn into a circle, their elaborately carved sides creating walls of color against the dimming sky. The air filled with the sweet smoke of herb-wood fires and the sound of children singing the traditional evening songs, their voices carrying across the plains.

Her grandmother emerged from their wagon, silver bangles chiming softly as she spread her weathered hands to test the wind's direction. Each bangle told a story - trades made, alliances forged, distances traveled. The old woman's bright shawl, layer upon layer of patterns collected from a dozen different peoples, caught the last rays of sunlight as she began to set out the implements for the evening meal. This was how it had always been: the wisdom of the road passed down through shared moments, through songs sung while the cooking pots bubbled, through tales told as the moons rose over the endless grass sea.

### The Lories Festival

The clearing near the Watch Tower hummed with music. Dozens of Lories wagons had gathered, arranged in concentric circles that sparkled with hundreds of hanging mirrors and brass chimes. At the heart of the gathering, Master Dravor drew his bow across the strings of a violin that had taken him three seasons to craft. The instrument's voice rang pure and true, calling other musicians to join - drums that echoed like distant thunder, pipes that whispered like wind through grass, strings that sang of joy and longing.

Young apprentices watched with wide eyes as the master players wove their songs together, each melody carrying the weight of tradition while leaving space for something new to emerge. In one wagon, carefully wrapped in red silk, lay a violin destined for the Imperial City, its wood carved with protective symbols so delicate they seemed to move in the lamplight. But here, in this moment, the music belonged to everyone - to the dancers who swirled in their bright skirts, to the elders who nodded in time, to the children who would someday carry these songs to distant lands.

### The Dramii Workshop

In the Dramii settlement of Kovarin, smoke rose from Baleshi's forge where old ways met new. The metalworker's hands moved with practiced precision as she shaped a piece of silver into a complex knot pattern - traditional Suranai design worked with techniques learned from the northern peoples. Around her permanent workshop, built of wagon wood and stone, other craftspeople had gathered to trade and work. Some still lived in their wagons, wheels ready for the road's call, while others had built small homes with gardens that crept between the structures like curious children.

The sound of her hammer rang out across the settlement, where wagons and houses stood side by side in an arrangement that spoke of both change and continuity. Young Suranai from other groups came here to learn the settled crafts while their elders debated in the meeting hall - its walls painted with scenes of the old wandering ways. In her workshop, Baleshi kept a small wagon wheel mounted above her forge, painted with protective symbols. Some said the Dramii were leaving the old ways behind, but she knew better. The road lived in their hearts, even when their wheels stood still.

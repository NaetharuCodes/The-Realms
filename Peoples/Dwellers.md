# The Dwellers

## Nature and Appearance

The Dwellers are beings of the deep earth, their skin pale as cave mushrooms and tough as root fiber. Their eyes are large and dark, adapted to the perpetual gloom of their underground realm, with a reflective quality that makes them shine like black mirrors in lamplight. They stand shorter than humans but are broad and powerful, moving with an unsettling fluid grace that belies their sturdy frame. Their fingers are long and nimble, ending in hardened tips adapted for climbing and digging.

## Culture and Behavior

Unlike their more sociable cousins in other lands' tales, the Dwellers are solitary and secretive. They gather only rarely in small groups called 'clutches', usually related by blood or ancient pacts. They mark their territories with intricate patterns carved into stone using their hardened fingertips - patterns that serve both as warnings and as complex numerical systems tracking debts, promises, and boundaries.

Their language is rarely heard above ground, consisting of low, resonant tones that carry well through stone. When they must speak with surface dwellers, they use a heavily accented common tongue that sounds as if it's being drawn up from deep wells.

## Dwellings and Territory

They make their homes in natural cave systems which they expand through patient centuries of carving and sculpting. These warrens are architectural marvels, though few surface dwellers who see them live to describe their beauty. The entrances to their domains are often unremarkable - a crack in a hillside, a hole beneath an ancient tree's roots - but the tunnels within are worked with mathematical precision.

The eastern mountains are riddled with their warrens, though surface maps showing their locations are inevitably incomplete or incorrect, as the Dwellers regularly seal old entrances and open new ones.

## Customs and Trade

Despite their fearsome reputation, the Dwellers maintain complex systems of trade and obligation. They follow strict, if alien, codes of conduct. A Dweller's word, once given, is absolutely binding - though one must be very careful about the exact wording of any agreement made with them. They trade in unusual currencies: memories, dreams, years of life, or moments of luck.

Their hunting patterns follow rules incomprehensible to surface dwellers but are actually quite predictable if one knows how to read the signs. They emerge most often during the dark of the moon, when the stars are brightest, and their hunting territories are marked with subtle signs in a script that spirals like water down a drain.

## Meeting the Dwellers

Those who must treat with the Dwellers know certain rules:

- Never enter their tunnels without invitation
- Always bring an offering (they prize unusual sounds, particularly musical notes never heard before)
- Make no promises you cannot keep
- Do not eat or drink anything they offer
- If you must fight them, stay in starlight - they are weakest under the stars' gaze

## Relations with Other Peoples

The Suranai know best how to trade with them, having developed complex protocols over centuries. Some Kakari caravans employ Dweller-speakers, specialists in negotiating with these beings. The Phasharthi rarely deal with them, though there are old stories of Dwellers emerging from sea caves during the lowest tides.

The rare human settlements in the eastern mountains maintain uneasy truces with local Dweller clutches, marking their boundaries with specific arrangements of stones and leaving regular offerings at agreed-upon sites.

## Vignettes

## The Night Market

The new moon had drawn her black curtain across the sky when Kalimo's caravan made camp in the shadow of the eastern mountains. This was no ordinary camp - the wagons were arranged in a perfect circle, their wheels marked with iron nails driven in precise patterns. The Suranai children, usually full of evening songs, were silent, watching their elders lay out strange treasures on red cloth: a bell that had never been rung, a mirror that had never reflected, a flute carved from wood that had grown in complete darkness.

They came as mist first - shadows deepening into forms that moved like water over stone. The Dwellers emerged from cracks in the earth that hadn't been there moments before, their dark eyes reflecting the starlight like still pools. The caravan's Dweller-speaker, an old woman wrapped in layers of grey silk, stepped forward with practiced care. Her hands moved in the ancient patterns as she spoke words that seemed to sink into the earth rather than travel through air.

The trading began. A Dweller's long fingers traced the surface of the unrung bell, its pale skin almost translucent in the starlight. Another held up a crystal that seemed to contain the memory of a waterfall. No human voice rose above a whisper as treasures changed hands according to rules laid down centuries ago. When it was done, the Dwellers melted away like frost in morning sun, leaving behind objects of impossible beauty and taking with them things whose absence would not be noticed until days later.

## The Hunter's Path

In the deepest part of night, when even owls had gone to roost, something moved through the mountain forest. Pale shapes flowed from shadow to shadow, their movements too fluid to be human, too purposeful to be animal. A Dweller hunting clutch was on the move. Their quarry had left no tracks that human eyes could see, but the hunters read signs in the angle of broken moss stems and the arrangement of disturbed pebbles.

Their leader paused, pressing long fingers against a boulder marked with spiral scratches. The stone remembered the passing of their prey, and the hunter tasted the memory with fingertips worn hard as cave crystal. The clutch moved on, spreading out in a pattern like water finding its way downhill. They made no sound - even the forest itself seemed to hold its breath as they passed.

The stars wheeled overhead, marking time in their ancient dance, as the hunters closed in on their quarry. What they sought, no surface dweller could say, but the hunt was bound by rules older than the mountains themselves.

## The Deep Court

The cave mouth was barely wide enough for a child to pass, but it led to chambers vast enough to swallow cathedrals. Here, in the deepest warren of the eastern mountains, the Dweller clutches gathered for their centennial meeting. The walls glittered with veins of crystal that caught and amplified the pale light emanating from fungi cultivated over centuries. The air hummed with their language - deep tones that resonated in bone rather than ear.

They came from every warren in the eastern range, each clutch marked by subtle variations in the patterns carved into their skin. They brought with them treasures and grievances, debts and offerings. The Great Hall was a mathematical marvel - its dimensions following rules of sacred geometry that would drive human architects to madness. In alcoves carved into living rock, Dweller record-keepers traced the history of ten thousand years with fingers that remembered every treaty, every debt, every promise made and kept or broken.

In the center of it all stood the Counting Stone - a spire of black rock carved with spiraling numbers that told the true names of every Dweller who had ever walked these halls. The clutches would debate and trade, settle ancient debts and forge new pacts, their movements following patterns as complex and inevitable as the growth of crystals. When they departed, days or weeks later, new laws would be carved into the rock, and new memories would be added to the endless spiral of their history.

# The Northern Waters

_As told to Kalimo of the Kakari by Maratha of the Phasharthi, recorded in the Season of Long Shadows_

I tell you this only because our peoples have traded in trust for generations, and because the winds are right and the moon is dark. Some tales are best kept for such nights.

## The Waters

We Phasharthi know waters - we read the tides as you Kakari read the plains. But the northern waters... they are wrong waters. Where our home shores blend salt and fresh in the natural way, those waters mix like oil and water, never truly joining. The tides there follow no patterns we can trust. Channels appear where no channel should be, and the waters sometimes flow uphill.

The fisher-folk there speak of places where the sea rises up in walls of mist that move against the wind. They say there are depths that have no bottom, where even weighted lines never find purchase. I have seen waters there that burn like fever-sweat when the moon is full, and heard sounds from the deep that make the gulls fall silent.

## The Isles

The maps I show you are incomplete, and not just from lack of exploration. The isles there refuse to be mapped. Ask three captains to chart the same waters and they will return with three different counts of the islands. Some appear only at certain tides, others seem to move between visits. The locals have names for some, though they won't speak them all aloud:

- The Wakeful Rocks, where no one has ever been seen to sleep
- The Isle of Turns, which some swear shows a different face from each direction
- The Waiting Place, which no one will speak of after sunset

Even the Greater Isles, the ones that hold settlements, feel wrong to those of us from southern waters. Their beaches are made of stones that ring like bells when the tide turns, and their cliffs wear faces that seem to shift when viewed too long.

## The Tower

_[Here the speaker paused for some time before continuing]_

No, I have never seen it up close. None of us have. It stands far beyond the last settlements, where the cliffs rise like broken teeth from waters we dare not sail. Those who fish these waters will not speak of it directly - they say only "the black thing on the crag" or "the watching place."

When the winter storms come from the far north, some claim they see lights moving in its heights. Not the steady beam of a lighthouse, no - these are said to crawl across the stone like stars falling sideways. The old women in the fishing villages tie iron rings above their doors on such nights.

There are tales of its keeper, though in twenty years of trading these waters, I've never met anyone who claims to have seen them clearly. A shape sometimes seen on the highest point of the tower, they say, too tall to be human. Movement in the mists that doesn't follow the rules of wind or wave.

## The Local Folk

The people who live nearest to the tower are changed by it, I think. They have customs that make no sense to outsiders - they will not paint their boats certain colors, they cast no nets on days when the clouds move against the wind, they weave patterns in their fishing ropes that hurt the eyes to look at.

They mark their doors with signs that they claim are for luck, but which I recognize from no language of man. Their children learn songs in their cradles that they say will keep them safe from the deep places, though they seem unable to remember the words when they grow older.

## A Warning

You ask if it can be seen from the trade roads? Yes, on certain days, if the weather is clear. But I warn you - do not seek it out. The tower is not for us to know. It stands guard over something that must be guarded, watches for something that must be watched. That is all we need to understand.

If you must sail these waters, heed these warnings:

- Never anchor in water you cannot see the bottom of
- If you hear singing that reminds you of your mother's voice, plug your ears with wax
- Do not count the isles you pass, and do not count twice if you do
- If you see lights beneath the water, do not look at them directly
- If you dream of the tower while at sea, make for shore immediately

_[Here ends the account, though Kalimo notes that Maratha would not speak further of the northern waters, and left the next morning despite favorable trading conditions]_

_[Note: The Red Chapel considers this account to be largely superstition, though certain details have been flagged for further investigation]_

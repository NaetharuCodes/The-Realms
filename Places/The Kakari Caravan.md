# The Long Road Caravan

_Compiled from the observations of Maratha of the Phasharthi, Council records of the eastern settlements, and the journey-marks of various Dweller-speakers_

## The Coming

You hear them before you see them - the deep toll of the caravan bells carried on the wind, a sound that's been calling settlements to trade since before their oldest stories. Then the dust on the horizon, rising like a tide. The Long Road Caravan appears gradually, wagon by wagon, until the whole train stretches across the grasslands like a river of color and movement.

They say you can read the fortunes of the eastern realms in how the wagons are arranged. In prosperous times, the brightly painted family wagons lead, their cloth awnings rippling with patterns collected from a hundred different peoples. In uncertain years, the heavy trade wagons take the front positions, their iron-bound wheels marking the earth in parallel lines that other caravans will follow for months to come.

## The Wagons

_[From the records of a settlement factor]_

Today's count: one hundred and thirty-seven wagons, not including the smaller carts that cluster around them like ducklings. The variety is worth noting:

- Family wagons with their raised living platforms and memory-cloths hanging in the windows
- Trade wagons, iron-reinforced, some so large they need six horses
- Workshop wagons with their sides that fold down into craftsmen's benches
- Storage wagons, plain but sturdy, smelling of spice and silk
- The medicine wagon with its herbs hanging in dry bunches from the roof
- The water wagons, their barrels wrapped in wet cloth that somehow never dries
- The map wagon (always locked, always guarded)

Some notes on the arrangements: food wagons towards the middle, where the dust is less. Trade goods spread throughout - never keep all your wealth in one place, as the Kakari say. The wagons with children placed where they can be circled most quickly if the need arises.

## The People

_[Observations from a lore-speaker's book of hours]_

They are not simply traders but keepers of connections. Each family specializes: the Vorathi are known for their skill with textiles, the Merendil for their knowledge of medicines, the Kalimar for their way with languages and protocols.

The children learn their letters by writing in the dust beside the wagons, and their numbers by helping to measure cloth and weigh spices. They say you can tell a Kakari child's family by how they tie their hair - though I've never quite worked out the system.

The elders' wagon is always at the heart of the train. They say its interior is hung with maps showing paths that don't appear on any chart I know, though I've never been invited to verify this.

## Movement and Rest

They have a way of making camp that's like watching a river find its course. Each wagon knows its place, each family its role. The great circle forms without apparent signal or command, though the positioning shifts based on wind and weather and other factors I suspect I don't fully understand.

_[Note from a settlement watchman]_
They came in just before sunset, one hundred and thirty-seven wagons making the turn into the trading grounds. Not a wheel out of place, not a single call needed to direct them. Like they were following tracks laid down by their grandparents' grandparents. Maybe they were.

## Trading Customs

_[Fragment from a Phasharthi trading record]_

The Long Road keeps to the old ways. No business before the greeting fires are lit. No trades confirmed until the elders have exchanged news of the roads. They bring out their finest goods gradually, over days - though I suspect they know exactly what they plan to trade from the moment they arrive.

Some items are never brought out in daylight. Some are traded only under specific stars. Best not to ask about these - they have their reasons, and the reasons have served them well enough to keep them prospering all these years.

## A Note on Maps

They mark their routes with subtle signs: a stack of stones here, a carved token there. They say the truly important markers are in the songs their children learn, though I've never heard the same song twice.

The map wagon remains a mystery. The guards are unfailingly polite and absolutely immovable. When asked directly about their charts, they smile and speak of weather and road conditions. Perhaps this is answer enough.

_[Marginal note in a different hand]_
Some roads exist only if you know they're there. The Kakari remember them all, written in wood and cloth and memory.

## Final Observations

_[From a settlement factor's personal journal]_

The Long Road Caravan departed this morning, all one hundred and thirty-seven wagons moving like a single great beast heading east. Or perhaps west - the dust made it hard to tell, and the bells seemed to come from every direction at once.

I've supervised their trading for twelve years now, and I still couldn't tell you exactly what makes them different from other caravans. Something in how they move, perhaps. Or in how the light catches their wagons at sunset. Or maybe it's just that they know things about the roads that the rest of us have forgotten.

My predecessor left only one piece of advice about dealing with them: Count the wagons when they arrive, count them when they leave. If the numbers don't match, don't mention it. Some questions are better left unasked.

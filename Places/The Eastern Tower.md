# The Eastern Tower

_From the trading journals of three Kakari caravans, with additional notes from the Lories' Song-Archives_

## The Watch

It stands at the edge of the grasslands where the trading roads converge, a tower of dark stone that seems to draw the eye without commanding it. Some say there are patterns in its weathered surface that suggest copper or brass, though these are only visible at certain times of day, and never in quite the same place twice.

The grasses grow differently in its shadow. Not better or worse, but with subtle variations in pattern that local herders have learned to read like scripture. The Lories speak of the tower's influence in whispers between verses of their oldest songs, though when pressed they claim these are merely traditional flourishes.

## The Watcher

_[Recorded by Kalimo of the Kakari, during the Season of Long Shadows]_

There is a man who tends the tower - or perhaps it would be more accurate to say there has always been a man who tends the tower. My grandmother's journals describe him much as I see him now: tall and straight-backed, with dark hair and beard, wearing robes that might be rich or simple depending on how the light falls.

He attends the moots sometimes, though never the same ones in sequence. His grasp of our tongues is perfect yet somehow awkward, like a poem recited by someone who knows the words but not the meaning. He shows interest in our ways, particularly our music, though I've noticed he never quite explains his own.

When he speaks of trade routes or weather patterns, caravans that follow his advice tend to prosper. Those who ignore it often find their chosen paths... difficult. We've learned not to press him for explanations.

## The Boundaries

_[From the journey-marks of a Dramii scout]_

There are stones around the tower, weathered things that might be natural formations if not for how they catch the light at dawn. The Lories claim there's a pattern to them. The Verdant mark their territory differently near these stones, though they won't say why.

I've tried to map the area three times now. Each attempt produces different results, though I measure carefully. It's not that the land changes - it's more that distance itself seems to have opinions. Best to trust the old paths here, and not look too closely at where they lead.

## The Rules

_[Gathered from various sources, mostly oral tradition among the trading peoples]_

Those who deal with the tower's keeper know certain rules, though none can say how they learned them:

- Approach at dawn or not at all
- Bring something new - a song unsung, a tale untold
- Mind your words carefully
- Give as you take
- Keep your eyes on the grasslands
- Accept what you're given, but never ask for more

## Notes on Recent Events

_[Extract from a letter between Lories elders]_

The young musician who spent so long talking with the keeper at last season's moot - something subtle has changed in her playing. Nothing you could point to directly, but the songs feel older somehow, as if they've acquired memories of their own. She claims they came to her in dreams, though she never remembers the dreams themselves.

The Keeper asked about the Northern Tower at the last gathering. Not directly - he never asks anything directly - but in a way that made the grass go still. When Maratha's name came up, he nodded as if confirming something. The wind changed shortly after, and the conversation turned to other things.

_[Marginal note in a different hand]_
Best leave such matters alone. Some things are not meant to be understood, only observed.

## A Warning

Remember that these accounts are incomplete, and perhaps inaccurate. The tower has stood longer than our songs remember, and will likely stand after our songs are forgotten. That is perhaps all we need to know.

Those who trade in these lands would do well to learn the old courtesies. Keep to the marked paths. Don't count the standing stones. And if you hear music on the wind that reminds you of a song you've never heard, it's best to make camp for the night and wait for dawn.

_[Final note, found tucked into a Kakari trading ledger]_
The stories say the tower watches the high places, but they never say what it watches for. Perhaps that's wisdom.
